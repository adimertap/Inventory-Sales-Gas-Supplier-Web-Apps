# Inventory and Sales Web Application for Gas Supplier PT. SuksesBerkahBertumbuh

Inventory & Sales Gas Supplier Web Application is a web-based application that supports all back office management, especially inventory and sales of gas and aqua products at PT. Suksesberkahbertumbuh. I am a Full-Stack Web Developer in developing this application starting from business processes, database design and code implementation. 

This application is made from the problems that occur at PT Suksesberkahbermbuh, namely the irregular number of incoming and outgoing stock causing inaccurate reporting, recording sales by employees who do not comply with operational standards. The solution to this problem is to build a web application for inventory and product sales.

Initially appeared on
[gist](https://gist.github.com/PurpleBooth/109311bb0361f32d87a2). But the page cannot open anymore so that is why I have moved it here.

## Feature
- Login and Master Data Management (Employees, Supplier, Supplier Type, Category, Product and Customer).
- Daily and Monthly Purchase Inventory Reporting.
- Dashboard Inventory, Purchase Order, Receiving and BIN Card Product.
- Dashboard Sales, Sales, Employee Sales.
- Daily and Monthly Sales Reporting.

## Development

The first step in application design is research, design thinking and business process design. The research is carried out by discussing with clients, the results of the research are business processes that are in accordance with standard operating procedures for Inventory and Sales.

There are 2 (two) roles in the application that have been created, including the Owner Role who works in managing all master data business processes and transaction reporting, the second is the Employee Role which functions to record all daily sales transactions.

### Tech Stack & Testing
Tech stack in application design which includes MySQL for databases, Laravel 8 Framework, Front-End HTML and CSS (Bootstrap 5), Backend PHP and Javascript. Business process design tools include Notion and Visual Studio Code for code implementation. The application has been tested and is running normally until now.

### Database
Database design is carried out on the MySQL application which is described in the form of PDM or Physical Data Model. PDM which was built as a guide in making Inventory and Sales Web Applications consisting of 13 entitas (table).
